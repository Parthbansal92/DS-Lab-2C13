Arrays (searching, sorting, inversions, matrix operations)

Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)

Stacks & Queues (array & pointer-based, postfix evaluation)

Recursion & Divide and Conquer

Trees (binary tree, BST, traversals)

Graphs (BFS, DFS, adjacency list/matrix)

Hashing & Sparse Matrices (triplet form, transpose, multiplication)

Sorting & Searching (merge sort, quick sort, binary search, linear search)
